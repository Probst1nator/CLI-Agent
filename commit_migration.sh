git commit -m "feat: Implement formal monorepo architecture with editable packages

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Tools now use proper editable package dependencies (-e ../../shared -e ../../core)
- Eliminated sys.path manipulation in favor of standard Python packaging
- Scoped .gitignore files for cleaner tool-specific ignore rules

NEW FEATURES:
- shared/ and core/ are now installable packages with pyproject.toml
- Tool independence: each tool can be installed with minimal dependencies
- Backward compatibility maintained for legacy py_classes imports
- Comprehensive setup documentation in SETUP.md

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Clean import statements following Python best practices  
- Explicit dependency declarations in tool requirements.txt
- Organized .gitignore structure with tool-specific rules
- Clear package boundaries and responsibilities

Migration benefits:
âœ… No more sys.path hacks - clean, standard imports
âœ… Explicit dependencies - clear tool requirements  
âœ… Backward compatibility - legacy imports still work
âœ… Easy tool extraction - tools can be distributed independently
âœ… Development efficiency - shared infrastructure automatically available

Install instructions:
1. pip install -e ./shared -e ./core
2. cd tools/[tool_name] && pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python main.py

Testing: All 15/15 tests pass with new architecture
