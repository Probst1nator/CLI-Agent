To make OneDrive and Syncthing automatically start on boot in Ubuntu, you can add them as systemd services. Here are the commands to do so:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable onedrive
sudo systemctl start onedrive

sudo systemctl enable syncthing
sudo systemctl start syncthing
```



sudo systemctl start onedrive
[sudo] password for prob: 
sudo systemctl start syncthing
sudo systemctl enable onedrive
sudo systemctl enable syncthing
'''bash_out
sudo systemctl start onedrive
```cmd_error
Failed to start onedrive.service: Unit onedrive.service not found.
```
sudo systemctl start syncthing
```cmd_error
Failed to start syncthing.service: Unit syncthing.service not found.
```
sudo systemctl enable onedrive
```cmd_error
Failed to enable unit: Unit file onedrive.service does not exist.
```
sudo systemctl enable syncthing
```cmd_error
Failed to enable unit: Unit file syncthing.service does not exist.
```

It seems that the services don't exist yet. Let's create them. 

First, create the service file for OneDrive:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/onedrive.service
```
Add the following content and save:
```
[Unit]
Description=OneDrive
After=network.target

[Service]
User=<your_username>
ExecStart=/usr/bin/onedrive
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Replace `<your_username with your actual username.

Next, create the service file for Syncthing:
>````bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/syncthing.service
```
Add the following content and save:
```
[Unit]
Description=Syncthing
After=network.target

[Service]
User=<your_username>
ExecStart=/usr/bin/syncthing
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Again, replace `<your_username with your actual username.

Then, reload the systemd daemon and enable the services:
>````bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable onedrive
sudo systemctl enable syncthing
```
Finally, start the services:
```bash
sudo systemctl start onedrive
sudo systemctl start syncthing
```
This should create and enable the services, allowing them to start on boot.
