# A custom general CLI-Agent solution, providing a hackable playground inside a langchain-like framework

This project introduces a CLI (Command Line Interface) Agent leveraging the Groq-API and Ollama backends, based on the Local Language Model Toolkit Project I've developed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Currently, only Ubuntu is supported.

### Installation

1. **Using the Installer Script**

   To add the CLI-Agent to your system, execute the `installer.sh` script:

   ```bash
   ./installer.sh
   ```

2. **Running Manually**

   Alternatively, you can run the Agent manually by executing `main.py`:

   ```bash
   python3 ./main.py
   ```

### Features

- **Command Suggestions:** The Agent suggests commands and, upon your confirmation, executes them. It will then discuss and act based on the output of these commands.
