# This is a simple CLI-Agent using Groq-API and Ollama as backends
# It is based on the (Local)-Language-Model-Toolkit Project, also developed by me

## Getting Started

### 1. Install
  # Only Ubuntu is supported for now
    You can add it to your cli by executing the "installer.sh", like this: "./installer.sh"
    You can also instead run it by executing the "main.py", like this "python3 ./main.py"

### 2. Features
    The Agent can suggest commands and run them after your confirmation, the bot will be informed of the the commands output and is able to dicuss and act upon it
