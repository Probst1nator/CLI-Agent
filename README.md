# Simple CLI Agent Using Groq-API and Ollama Backends

This project introduces a CLI (Command Line Interface) Agent that leverages the Groq-API and Ollama backends. It is part of the Local Language Model Toolkit Project that I have developed.

## Getting Started

#### Docker/ Groq

The large langue model needs to be hosted somewhere, I recommend the Groq-API for quick and powerful model responses but Ollama is also supported.

Add your GROQ_API_KEY to the .env file, you can get one here:

Run the Ollama backend in a Docker container:
   ```bash
   sudo docker run -d --name ollama --restart always -p 5000:11434 ollama/ollama:latest
   ```


#### Run from script

1. The easiest way to use the Agent is like this:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ./easy_runner.sh
   ./easy_runner.sh
   ```

#### Run from cli

1. To add the CLI Agent to your command line, execute the `add_alias_to_bash.sh` script:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ./installer.sh
   ./installer.sh
   ```

### Features

- **Command Suggestions:** The Agent suggests commands and, upon your confirmation, executes them. It discusses and acts based on the output of these commands.
