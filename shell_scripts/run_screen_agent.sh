You can create the file by coding it inside a multiline python string and saving it to a html file. Please ensure the absolute path of the html file is printed at the end of the script. Because of repeated issues please do not use latex at all.", "Lastly, please author some tooltips to add to the existing html file, use them to add educational information, definitions or descriptions. You can implement search and replace operations to interact with the html files contents more seamlessly than re-writing the whole file.", "Please open the file in firefox, run it such that it isnt blocking your environment."
