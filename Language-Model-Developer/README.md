# Welcome to the (Local)-Language-Model-Toolkit

Welcome to the (Local)-Language-Model-Toolkit, an open-source framework designed for integrating advanced language models into your applications. Ideal for both experienced developers and beginners, this toolkit simplifies the process of leveraging language models for automation and contextual understanding.

## Getting Started

### 1. **Install the Required Dependencies**
- Install necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Use the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### 2. **Configure Environment**
- **OpenAI Setup (Optional)**: If you plan to use OpenAI models, insert your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file.
  - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
  - Add your OpenAI API key.

### 3. **Install and Set Up Ollama with Docker**
- Ensure Ollama is installed on your system.
- The project uses Ollama, running in a Docker container, to manage language models.
- Ollama is interfaced through its REST API.
- If the Ollama Docker container is not running, the project will automatically start it when needed.

### 4. **Run Your Project**
- Simply run the `main.py` file.
- Ollama manages local language model support, including fetching models from the Ollama model library `https://ollama.ai/library`.

### 5. **Customize Your Project**
- Start experimenting in the `main.py` file for custom development.
- Ollama automatically handles model downloads as needed.
