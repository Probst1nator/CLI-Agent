## üß™ Testing & Development

- `test.py` - Unified, user-facing entrypoint for the entire test suite. This script provides a simple command-line interface with modes like `--quick`, `--full`, and `--verbose`, orchestrating the underlying test infrastructure to provide clear, actionable results for developers. This is the primary command to run for validating changes.

- `run_tests.py` - The core test runner infrastructure that powers `test.py`. This module is responsible for the low-level mechanics of test discovery (scanning for `test_*` functions), hierarchical execution based on defined levels (e.g., unit, integration), and aggregating results. Developers typically don't run this script directly.

- `profiling.py` - A diagnostic utility script for profiling Python import times. By running this script, developers can identify which modules or dependencies are contributing most to application startup latency, helping to optimize the initial load time.

- `.env.example` - A template file that defines the necessary environment variables, such as API keys and configuration settings. Developers should copy this to a `.env` file and populate it with their own credentials, keeping sensitive information out of version control.

- `requirements.txt` - A standard file listing all necessary Python packages for the project. It is used with `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure a consistent and reproducible development environment.

- `main.py` - The primary entrypoint and orchestration script for the agentic coding assistant. This file initializes the agent's core "Monte Carlo Action Engine," which uses a council of LLMs for specialized tasks: proposing multiple action paths (Branch Generators), voting on the best path (Branch Evaluators), and vetoing unsafe code (Execution Guards). It manages the main execution loop, handles user input, and enriches the agent's context by retrieving tool usage hints and strategic "playbooks" from a vector database. Now includes enhanced path-aware permission system for tool execution.

- `enhanced_permissions.py` - Enhanced permission system providing interactive prompts with persistent "always allow" functionality. Supports path-specific permissions, directory-based rules, and intelligent permission scoping with options like exact file, directory pattern, project-wide, or tool-wide permissions.

- `permissions_manager.py` - Persistent permission storage manager handling tool-specific and path-specific permission rules. Manages JSON-based configuration storage in user's home directory with support for directory patterns, exact path matching, and permission inheritance.
